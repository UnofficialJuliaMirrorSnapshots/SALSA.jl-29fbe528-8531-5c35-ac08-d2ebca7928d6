Clustering
================

A clustering example is explained for the SALSA package on the Iris dataset [UCI2010]_. 

This package provides a function ``salsa`` and explanation on ``SALSAModel`` for the clustering case. This use case is supported by the particular choices of loss functions and distance metrics applied within the Regularized K-Means approach [JS2015]_ and cross-validation criterion ``SILHOUETTE`` (`Silhouette index <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)>`_). 

.. code-block:: julia

   using SALSA, Clustering, Distances, MLBase, Base.Test

   Xf = readcsv(joinpath(Pkg.dir("SALSA"), "data", "iris.data.csv"))
   Y = convert(Array{Int}, Xf[:,end])
   k_clusters = length(unique(Y))
   dY = Array{Int}(length(Y))
   X = Xf[:,1:end-1]
   srand(1234)
   
   algorithm = RK_MEANS(k_clusters)
   model = SALSAModel(LINEAR, algorithm, LEAST_SQUARES,
            validation_criterion=SILHOUETTE(),
            global_opt=DS([-1]), process_labels=false,
            cv_gen = Nullable{CrossValGenerator}(Kfold(length(Y),3)))
   model = salsa(X, dY, model, X)
   mappings = model.output.Ytest

By taking a close look at the code snippet above we can notice that we use a special type of an algorithm :func:`RK_MEANS` which implements approach in [JS2015]_. By instantiating ``RK_MEANS(k_clusters)`` we provide a maximum number of clusters to be extracted. Learning of individual prototype vectors will be repeated ``algorithm.max_iter`` times after re-partitioning of the dataset ``X`` (by default ``algorithm.max_iter==20``). The default choice of the loss function is ``LEAST_SQUARES`` and the distance metric is ``Euclidean()`` [#f1]_. This corresponds to the original setting of the unregularized K-Means approach. Please refer to :doc:`Algorithms <algorithms>` section and :func:`RK_MEANS` function for more details regarding which combinations of loss functions and metrics are supported.
